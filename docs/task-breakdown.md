# Task Breakdown, Prioritization & Assignment: EMR Billing & Inventory Management System

This document outlines the tasks, priorities, estimated effort, assignees, and rationale behind the breakdown for developing the EMR billing and inventory management system.

## Rationale for Task Splitting

The project is split into functional modules (User Management, Inventory Management, Prescription Management, Billing, Audit Logging, Notifications) and technical areas (Frontend, API Gateway). This approach achieves the following:

*   **Modularity:** Each module encapsulates related functionality, improving code organization and maintainability.
*   **Parallel Development:** Teams can work on different modules independently, accelerating development.
*   **Clear Ownership:** Each module has a clear owner, fostering accountability and focus.
*   **Flexibility:** Modules can be modified or replaced independently, enhancing adaptability to changing requirements.

Within each module, tasks are further broken down into smaller, more manageable units to ensure clear goals and facilitate progress tracking.

## Rationale for Prioritization and Assignment

Tasks are prioritized based on their criticality to the core system functionality, dependencies, and potential impact on user experience.

*   **High Priority:** Tasks essential for the minimum viable product (MVP) and core workflows.
*   **Medium Priority:**  Important tasks that enhance the user experience or system robustness but are not strictly required for the initial release.
*   **Low Priority:** Tasks that can be deferred to later iterations or are nice-to-haves.

Assignment considers team members' skills, experience, and availability.

*   **Senior Developers:** Complex tasks requiring deep technical expertise.
*   **Backend/Frontend Developers:** Tasks within their respective areas of specialization.
*   **UI/UX Designer:** User interface design and user experience optimization.
*   **DevOps Engineer:** Infrastructure setup, deployment, and configuration.
*   **QA Engineer:** Thorough testing of all features and edge cases.

## Assumptions

*   **Team Size:** A team of 8-10 members is assumed, including developers, designers, DevOps, and QA.
*   **Project Timeline:** Estimated at approximately 3 months, with flexibility for adjustments based on progress and unforeseen challenges.
*   **Technology Stack:** As specified earlier (Node.js, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Zod, Pino).
*   **Agile Development:**  The project will follow an Agile methodology with iterative development and frequent feedback loops.
*   **Dedicated Roles:** Team members are assumed to have dedicated roles and responsibilities (not shared across multiple areas).
*   **Collaborative Environment:**  The team is expected to collaborate closely and communicate effectively.
*   **Availability of Resources:**  Necessary hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure (GCP) are assumed to be available.
*   **Requirement Stability:** While some flexibility is expected, major requirement changes mid-project could significantly impact the timeline.
